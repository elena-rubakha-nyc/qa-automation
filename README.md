# The difference between git pull and git fetch.

## git fetch

Git Fetch is the command that tells the local repository that there are changes available in the remote repository without bringing the changes into the local repository.

## git pull

Git Pull on the other hand brings the copy of the remote directory changes into the local repository. Let us look at Git Fetch and Git Pull separately with the help of an example!!!

##git commit --amend

The git commit --amend command is a convenient way to modify the most recent commit. It lets you combine staged changes with the previous commit instead of creating an entirely new commit. It can also be used to simply edit the previous commit message without changing its snapshot.
